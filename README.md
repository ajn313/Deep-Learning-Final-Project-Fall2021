# Deep-Learning-Final-Project-Fall2021

Current status: Complete!  
The TGAN Car Generator is the main Python notebook.  
The TDCGAN proof of concept is a secondary project I did to further explore the architecture concept I was working on.  
Both the pruned and unpruned datasets are included as csv files  
I also included the Data Reader script that I wrote for this project, as I'm still very proud to have figured that out.  
I really would like to further explore the possibilities of the TGAN architecture I outlined here, as it does seem to be novel  
It is similar to a Conditional GAN, but I think using an entirely trained Labeler network opens up a huge amount of possibilities in other fields.
